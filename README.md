Question 1
Write the following functional interfaces and implement them using lambda expressions:
Check whether the first number is greater than the second number (Parameters: int, int; Return type: boolean).
Increment a number by 1 and return the incremented value (Parameter: int; Return type: int).
Concatenate two strings (Parameters: String, String; Return type: String).
Convert a string to uppercase and return it (Parameter: String; Return type: String).

Question 2
Using method references:
Create and apply instance method references for add and subtract methods.
Create and apply a static method reference for a multiply method.
Use a functional interface to apply all three operations.

Question 3
Implement multiple inheritance using interfaces with default methods.
Create two interfaces InterfaceA and InterfaceB with default methods.
Create a class that implements both and resolves the method implementations.

Question 4
Write a program to demonstrate constructor reference.
Create a class Person with a constructor that accepts a String name.
Use a functional interface and constructor reference (ClassName::new) to instantiate the object.
